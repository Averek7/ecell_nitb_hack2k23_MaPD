# Blockchain-based Decentralised Supply Chain Management System

A key component of company operations is supply chain management, which enables organisations to monitor the flow of products and services from the procurement of raw materials to the final consumer.
The current supply chain management systems, however, are disjointed, opaque, and open to fraud and counterfeiting, which causes inefficiencies and a breakdown in confidence between various parties.

### Problems:
* Supply chain process fragmentation causing inefficiencies and a lack of cooperation between many stakeholders.
* Lack of security and transparency in the supply chain makes it challenging for businesses to manage their supply chain efficiently and guarantee the quality of their products. 
* Vulnerability to fraud and counterfeiting, which causes businesses to lose money and their good name. 

### Objective:
Our project's goal is to keep track of all product transfer details.
It would result in a safe, logical, and transparent network chain that would follow the flow of goods from the producer to the final consumer.
As the consumer can verify the product using the QR code, it will stop them from purchasing replica goods. 

### Project Flow

1. Through authentication, we would create an admin account who is both the manufacturer and the vendor.![Screenshot from 2023-02-12 20-49-34]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77295367/218321576-31280773-fee8-425e-ba16-0fc622ce60fb.png)

2. The manufacturer will upload photo of the product, add description and title and will click on mint. These would mint the product in polygon chain.

3. The manufacturer will click on mint after uploading a photo of the product, adding a description, and adding a title. These would produce the item in a polygonal chain.
4. Manufacturers and vendors can view their profiles and transactions.

5. Any consumer or any party can scan the QR code to access our website and access all the product and transfer information there.
